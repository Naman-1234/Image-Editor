# About
Image-Editor as its name suggests is an image editor. It lets you edit multiple photos, You only have to edit properties mentioned in the slider and it will edit all the photos for you.

### Inspiration
I got an idea of building this, when I had to compare multiple photos for a small Mini-Project in different look. It just was kind of massacre to test by looking into each, Also it did not give a better clarity. That's when I thought of building this.

### Usage
Please find the following [video](https://youtu.be/-BKU6ozhWrQ) to know how to use this 

### Glimpse
A Glimpse of this webApp could be taken by the following screenshots:

### Miscellaneous

- <strong>Why didn't use Backend?</strong><br>
At the time of making this Web App, I did know enough backend and middlewares like Multer which could have been made things much easier.
But I was curious if this problem could be solved using Frontend only. I thought of giving it a try and it came well and it taught me a lot in the FrontEnd domain.

- <strong>Why didn't I use any Inbuilt Image Editor</strong>
As mentioned in the previous Paragraph, I build this webApp for sole purpose of learning and enhancing my skills. Without using library I got to learn about image proprties in css.

- <strong>Learning Outcomes<br>
Through building this I learnt many things, some of them are:<br>
    1. Blob(Binary Large Objects).<br>
    2. Better knowledge of React.<br>
    3. Libraries like jsZip.<br>
    4. Enhancements of Css Skills

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
